#A simple solution is to find all prime factors of both numbers, then
#find intersection of all factors present in both numbers. Finally
#return product of elements in the intersection.

#An efficient solution is to use Euclidean algorithm which is the main
#algorithm used for this purpose. The idea is, GCD of two numbers
#doesnâ€™t change if smaller number is subtracted from a bigger number.
